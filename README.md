#### Realistic data-based stochastic modelling of tree morphologies


Our approach is based upon five distinct parts:
1.	Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) that is to be obtained from the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data (see [Raumonen et al., 2013]).
2. Stochastic Structural Model (SSM), that is an analytical tree growth model. For example, one of Functional-Structural Plant Models (FSPM) or structural models with heuristic rules for growth (SHM or procedural models).	
3. Structural data sets, that is data sets U relating different physical dimensions as well as spatial location of various parts and segments of a tree with optional sorting by the topological characteristics.
4. Distance, that is a measure of proximity between any two data sets, in other words, a value quantifying how similar the two data sets are. 
5. Optimization algorithm, that is an iterative procedure capable of finding a minimum of any given function (Newton algorithm, genetic algorithm etc.).
