## Distance measure code

Set of routines to calculate the structural distance, which is based on the idea
of the distribution tomography (written by Marko Järvenpää).

The distance is a quantitative measure attempting to calculate the complexity
of empirical distributions and to compare any given pair of distributions.
Structural distance compares the empirical distributions of geometrical and
topological features of the tree structures.

See elsewhere the extensive description of the method.
