## Optimization tools

Optimization routines, designed mainly for the Genetic Algorithm (GA) of the Matlab
Optimization Toolbox.

This set of routines establishes an easier interface to somewhat complex 
Matlab's Optimization Toolbox configuration, additionally they are tuned for the
specific type of data (tree morphology) dealt with in BayesForest Toolbox.
