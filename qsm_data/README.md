## Laser Scanning Data processing tools

Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) is a reconstruction of the laser scanning
point cloud giving the whole topology of the measured tree or geometrical 
attributes of its components. In Bayes Forest we use QSM's as data to fit
our Stochastic Structural Models to.
