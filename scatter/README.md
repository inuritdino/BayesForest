## Scatter manipulation tools

Scatter is a multidimensional structural dataset describing geometry and topology
of any given tree (both experimentally obtained QSM's and analytical SSM's).
This set of routines extracts and arranges the data sets so that QSM (data) 
structural distributions correspond fully to SSM (model) distributions.
